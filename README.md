## 🏙️ Smart Home Front-End Dashboard

With Nairobi’s real estate scene booming and more residents moving into high-rise apartment complexes, the demand for urban smart living has risen significantly. High-rise apartments often come with unique challenges: limited space, shared infrastructure, heightened security needs, and growing concerns about energy efficiency. Technology offers practical solutions by making homes more connected, manageable, and sustainable.

This project explores how smart living technologies can be integrated into modern apartments to improve the quality of life for residents. By combining interactive design with modern web frameworks, the dashboard provides a centralized interface for controlling and monitoring smart home devices.
